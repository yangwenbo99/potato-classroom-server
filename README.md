# potato-classroom-server

This project aims to provide a simple and efficient server for assisting interactive classroom learning experience, regardless of whether it is face-to-face or online.  We aim at constructing a FOSS alternative for iClick. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yangwenbo99/potato-classroom-server.git
```
2. Install the required dependencies
```bash
   cd potato-classroom-server
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the server
```bash
python main.py
```

Note that this method should only be used for testing purpose.  If you have a very large classroom, you should probably consider using a "production WSGI server". 

## Licensing and Acknowledgements

I intended to release this project using GPT or MIT license (or even WTFPL), but since this project heavily used ChatGPT for development, I have to confirm the quality and independence of the code before releasing it as a FOSS.
